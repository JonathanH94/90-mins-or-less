# Movie Recommendation App

This is a simple Flask application that recommends a random film that is 90 minutes or less.


## How It Works

- Click the button on the homepage
- Get a random movie recommendation under 90 minutes
- Perfect for quick movie night!

## Files

 - `app.py` - Main Flask application
 - `templates/` - HTML templates
 - `static/` - CSS and other static files


## Dataset

I used the basic IMDb non-commerical dataset: https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/

Additional data for the result (i.e. poster, ratings etc.) was obtained from the OMDb API: https://www.omdbapi.com/
